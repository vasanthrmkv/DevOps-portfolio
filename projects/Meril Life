**Flow Summary:**
1. Developers push code to GitHub → triggers Jenkins pipeline.  
2. Jenkins builds app, runs SonarQube scan, creates Docker image.  
3. Terraform provisions infra → EKS, EC2, RDS, IAM, S3.  
4. Jenkins deploys app to EKS → updates service via rolling strategy.  
5. Prometheus & Grafana monitor app metrics and alert on anomalies.

## 🚀 Outcomes
- Reduced manual infra setup time by **80%**.  
- Increased deployment speed and consistency with IaC.  
- Improved application uptime to **99.9%** with EKS and monitoring.  
- Strengthened AWS compliance and security posture.
