**Flow:**
1. Code pushed to GitHub triggers Jenkins job.  
2. Jenkins builds app, runs tests, and pushes Docker image to ECR.  
3. Terraform provisions AWS infra (VPC, EKS, RDS).  
4. Ansible deploys application on the EKS nodes.  
5. Prometheus & Grafana track metrics and alert on anomalies.

## 🚀 Outcomes
- Reduced manual configuration drift across environments.  
- Improved release cycle from weekly to daily.  
- Achieved **99% uptime** with auto-healing Kubernetes clusters.  
- Enhanced system observability and on-call efficiency.
